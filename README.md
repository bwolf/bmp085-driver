## What works

- Reading the calibration coefficients from the sensor eeprom
- Reading the uncompensated temperature from the sensor
- Converting the uncompensated temperature to dâ„ƒ
- Reading the uncompensated pressure from the sensor
- Converting the uncompensated pressure to hPa
- Converting the pressure in hPa to hPa relative to altitude normal null (optional feature)
